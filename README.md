# AltGraph

**AltGraph is a set of alternative graph implementations built on the Azure CosmosDB SQL API**.

**AltGraph is not a product**. Instead, it is a general design and set of
**reference-applications**.

This implementation of AltGraph is built with the **C#** programming language, and
the **ASP.NET Core** and **Razor Pages** frameworks. In addition, the **IEvanjelist.Azure.CosmosRepository** library is used to simply the CosmosDB communication. **D3.js** is used in
the Web UI for visualizations, but you can use any similar JavaScript library
for your implementations.

At this time, **there are two designs and implementations for your reference**:

- A **version 1** design uses the concept of "RDF Triples" to implement a Bill-of-Materials
  graph using **NPM** data (the Node Package Manager tool in the Node.js ecosystem).
  The graph of NPM library dependencies can be seen as a bill-of-materials.

- A **version 2** design featuring more in-memory functionality and the **JGraphT**
  software library. This implementation used the **IMDb** (Internet Movie Database)
  dataset as a very rich social-network. The large downloadable IMDb datasets
  encourage the exploration of "the six degrees of Kevin Bacon".
  The wrangled AltGraph IMDb data contains over **1-million vertices and 3.9 million edges**,
  all stored in-memory in the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) with JGraphT.

These implementations may be used as-is, or as a starting point for your own implementations.
Both are designed to showcase the power and efficiency of the **CosmosDB SQL API**
for graph solutions.
